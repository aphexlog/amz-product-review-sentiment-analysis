# Project: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using Amazon SageMaker

## Day 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

    •	Task: Use an existing dataset of Amazon product reviews (you can find one on Kaggle or the AWS datasets).
    •	Steps:
    •	Load the dataset into a SageMaker notebook.
    •	Perform basic data cleaning (e.g., removing null values, basic text preprocessing like lowercasing, removing punctuation, etc.).
    •	Split the dataset into training and test sets.

## Day 2: Model Training, Evaluation & Deployment

    •	Task: Train a simple sentiment analysis model using SageMaker’s built-in algorithms, such as BlazingText or an LSTM model.
    •	Steps:
    •	Train the model on your preprocessed data.
    •	Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy or F1-score.
    •	Deploy the trained model as an endpoint in SageMaker.
    •	Create a simple test where you input a new review and get the predicted sentiment.

## Bonus (Optional, if time permits):

    •	Model Inference & API Integration:
    •	Create a small API using Lambda or a Flask app to take new review inputs and return the sentiment prediction.
    •	Visualization:
    •	Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize the distribution of sentiments in your dataset.

## Time Breakdown:

    •	Day 1: 4-6 hours for data collection and preprocessing.
    •	Day 2: 4-6 hours for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
